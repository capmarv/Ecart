# Step 1: Use Maven image to build the project
FROM maven:3.9.6-eclipse-temurin-17 AS builder

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the entire project into the container
COPY . .

# Build the application (skip tests to make it faster)
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Use a lightweight JDK image to run the built JAR
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file from the build stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose the backend port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the JAR file
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
